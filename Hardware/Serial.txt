DMLD Serial Protocol:

/CLK
DATA
/CAP

When /CAP goes low, the CPLD prepares to capture a "frame". It will then

1) Panel ID (8 bits)
2) Line ID (3 bits)
3) Line data (8 bits)

If the Panel ID matches the one set with the DIP switch, the Line ID is then
used to determine which octal flip flop's /WE line to pull low. Following 
that, the captured line data is then latched into the flip flop.
