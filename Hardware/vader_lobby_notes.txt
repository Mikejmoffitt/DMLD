The elevator lobby has a rough area of 

    81" x 46"

Now let's get that into real-man units, rounding down:

	205cm x 116cm

If we make a lot of 10 x 10cm boards, each board an 8x8 array, we get
a display 

	20 x 11 panels ( 220 panels total )

in size, which gives a resolution of

	160 x 88

pixels. 

DirtyPCBs will be able to make that for us with a division of a regular
200bd order, plus two protopacks (10 x 10cm is the protopack max). The
PCB cost will be: 

	$425 shipped for the batch of 200
	$14 x 2 shipped for the 2 orders of 10 protopack

Obviously, we should buy the protopack first to be sure the boards
actually will work.
