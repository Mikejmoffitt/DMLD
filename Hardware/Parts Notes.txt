Parts:
64 D flip-flops (74hc273 is an octal D flip flop)
32 AND gates
8 NAND gates
4 NOT gates
29 pullup resistors
1 8-positon DIP switch
About 100 headers


Actual parts needed:
8 x 74hc273
64 x 525nm 5mm LED
64 x 68 ohm resistor (100 ohm would probably work, look into resistor packs?)
28 x 10k resistors (pull ups)
